# AudioAxis Music App

Welcome to AudioAxis, a music streaming application developed using the Spotify API. 

## Overview

AudioAxis allows users to discover, listen, and enjoy their favorite music tracks, albums, and playlists from Spotify's extensive catalog. Users can search for songs, create playlists, follow artists, and much more.

## Deployment

AudioAxis was successfully devloped in the browser. However, after deployment, the Spotify API subscription timed out, causing some functionality to be temporarily disabled.

We are currently working on renewing our subscription to the Spotify API to restore full functionality to AudioAxis. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your patience as we resolve this issue.
